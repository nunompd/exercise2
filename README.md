# Exercise 2

### Level: - Junior and Medior

- In this app, we have a product page listing a few products. Now we need to create a product-detail component to show the rest of the product’s info. Also, when the user clicks on a product that’s already selected, the product-detail component should be hidden.

- Requirements

  - When the user clicks on a product’s name, the product-detail component should be shown in the same products page showing all properties of the clicked product
  - When the user clicks on a product that’s already selected, the product-detail component should not be visible anymore
  - On the product-detail component, add a "Close" button that, when clicked, should also hide the product's details
